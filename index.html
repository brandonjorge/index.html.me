<h1>The Best Movies According to Brandon</h1>
<h2>My top  movies of all-time.</h2>
<h3>Beverly Hills Cop 1-3</h3>
<p>The string of these Eddie Murphy films are funny with classic punchlines that kept me wanting more. For example "I'm not going to fall for the banana in the tailpipe!" Classic!  </p>
<h3>The Golden Child</h3>
<p>I can always watch this film because it always moves me in a nostagic way.</p>
<h3>The Last Dragon</h3>
<p>This movie has a storyline that held my attention as a child. </p>
<h3>Never Ending Story</h3>
<p>This anime movie is one that my sister and I watched many times.</p>
<h3>Legend</h3>
<p>A movie with Tom Cruise in the 80's startled me as a child but still watched with anticipation.</p>
<h3>Kung Fu Hustle</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite Kung Fu movies of all time. It has a great storyline that holds your focus and will have you laughing the entire time.</p>
<h3>The Truman Show</h3> 
<p>I think this is one of Jim Careys deeper works of art. Different from what was usually seen from Jim being the goofy never serious charactor. I thought this was a refreshing switch up .  </p>
